# Trivia

This is a simple web application for playing a trivia game where players are asked
questions about interesting but unimportant facts in many subjects.

The application allows the players to:
1) Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show
the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
2) Delete questions.
3) Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4) Search for questions based on a text query string.
5) Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.

The application is locally hosted at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` ([backend](https://github.com/yoonspark/fsnd-trivia/tree/master/backend))
and `http://127.0.0.1:3000/` ([frontend](https://github.com/yoonspark/fsnd-trivia/tree/master/frontend)).
More details can be found in each stack's subdirectory.
